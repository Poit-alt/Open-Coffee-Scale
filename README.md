[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

After researching some coffee scales for brewing, I was met with high prices and bad integrations of apps.  So I decided to make my own.  How hard could it be? The plan is to not use an app but rather a ESP32 with a TFT display to simplify things.  An app is only going to be a hassle in the early morning. Here I will rather aim for fast and simplistic brewing.

Here's what i want to make:
* A scale able to display weight.
* Ratio guide of water to coffee.
* Timer to help with brewing time.
* Battery powered, rechargable thru USB-C.
* Waterproof would be nice.

This is a side project for me while i'm batteling thru my electrical engineering degree, so frequent updates may be lacking.
